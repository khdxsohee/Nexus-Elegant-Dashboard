## ✨ KEY FEATURES

### 🖥️ **Global Telemetry & Real-Time Analytics**
Monitor your infrastructure with pixel-perfect data visualizations. Nexus uses high-performance Recharts components to render real-time compute load, revenue metrics, and network throughput.

### 🤖 **Deep Gemini AI Integration**
The heart of Nexus is a persistent, context-aware AI assistant powered by Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash. It can analyze project data, suggest security audits, and automate deployment instructions via a natural language interface.

### 🌐 **Multi-Node Infrastructure Mapping**
Visualize your global footprint. Track server health, latency (RTT), and load distribution across EU-West, US-East, and AP-South regions with live-updating status indicators.

### 📁 **Workspace Matrix**
Manage complex projects with an intuitive grid system. Each project card features real-time progress bars, priority tagging, and team presence avatars to keep your workflow synchronized.

### 🎨 **Elite UI/UX Experience**
Featuring a glassmorphic "Dark Matter" theme, Nexus utilizes deep backdrop blurs, subtle animations, and high-quality Lucide icons to deliver a professional engineering aesthetic.
